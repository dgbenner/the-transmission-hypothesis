## REDDIT SUBREDDITS

### r/InternetIsBeautiful ❌  PULLED AS DOES NOT ALLOW GALLERIES OR VIDEO (View Data: [summary])
**Why:** Made for unique web experiences exactly like this  
**Audience:** ~17M members, love discovering hidden internet gems  
**Best Framing:** Mysterious discovery, no self-promotion tone  
**Post Timing:** Anytime, but weekday mornings (EST) get best traction

**SUGGESTED POST:**

**Title:**
```
Found this strange 24/7 transmission feed - rotates through obscure films with scheduled "designated transmissions"
```

**Body:**
```markdown
Not sure what this is exactly, but it's been running continuously. Seems to cycle through random videos most of the time, then switches to scheduled events at specific GMT times (00:00, 08:00, 16:00). 

Has this whole retro terminal/broadcast aesthetic with signal codes and frequency drift. No controls - you just tune in and see what's transmitting.

## TIMING STRATEGY

### NOW (Current State)
**Ready for:**
- r/InternetIsBeautiful ✅
- r/vaporwave
- Twitter/X

**Why:** Site is functional and interesting as-is

---

### PHASE 2 (After adding 1-2 features)
**Add:** Theater seating map OR carousel preview banner

**Then post to:**
- r/WebDev
- r/ObscureMedia
- Hacker News

**Why:** More interactive elements = more to discuss

---

### PHASE 3 (After haunted transmission effects)
**Add:** Glitch effects, subliminal content, analog corruption

**Then post to:**
- r/glitch_art
- r/VHS
- r/horror
- r/ARG (if you add cryptic elements)

**Why:** Visual effects make it much more shareable, gif-able

---

### PHASE 4 (Feature Complete + HAM Radio Context)
**Add:** Synchronized broadcast, full effect system

**Then post to:**
- Product Hunt
- Bigger announcement on all platforms
- Potentially reach out to media (The Verge, Ars Technica, etc.)

**Why:** Complete vision realized, compelling narrative

## POST-LAUNCH TIPS

### General Reddit Rules:
- Don't repost to same sub within 6 months
- Engage with comments (but stay mysterious if that's the vibe)
- Post during US business hours (10am-2pm EST) for best visibility
- Don't mention it's your project if framing as "found this"

### What to Track:
- Which platform drives most traffic (check Cloudflare Analytics)
- User behavior per source (time on site, bounce rate)
- Which videos people engage with most
- Peak viewing times

### Follow-Up Posts:
- "Update: added [feature]" posts can work on some subs
- Share development process on Are.na, Mastodon
- Consider blog posts explaining technical implementation

---

## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If Post Gets Removed:
- r/InternetIsBeautiful has strict rules - read sidebar carefully
- Some subs don't allow self-promotion (frame as discovery)
- Have backup subs ready

### If Negative Reception:
- Some people won't get it - that's fine
- Ignore "what's the point" comments
- Engage with constructive criticism
- Remember: experimental art isn't for everyone

### If Goes Viral:
- Cloudflare R2 bandwidth is FREE - no cost spike
- GitHub Pages has generous limits
- Site should handle traffic fine
- Be ready to answer questions about concept/tech

## NOTES

- Start with r/InternetIsBeautiful as test case
- See what resonates (technical? aesthetic? mystery?)
- Adjust messaging for other platforms based on feedback
- Don't rush - space out posts, let each have impact
- Consider creating throwaway Reddit account for "found this" framing vs main account for "I built this" framing
