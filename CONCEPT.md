## VISUAL IDENTITY & TYPOGRAPHY

### Font System
**Primary Typefaces:**
- **IBM Plex Mono** - Body text, UI elements, high readability
- **VT323** - Headers, protocol names, authentic CRT terminal feel  
- Both available free via Google Fonts

**Typography Specifications:**
- Protocol names: 24-32px, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.1em
- Time remaining: 18-24px, clear and minimal
- Seat count: 14-18px, small but legible
- Status messages: 12-14px, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.05em

**Color Palette:**
- Background: `#000000` (pure black, no gray)
- Primary text: `#00FF00` (terminal green, classic CRT phosphor)
- Alternative: `#FFBF00` (amber CRT option)
- Dim/inactive: `#003300` (dark green for inactive elements)

**Special Characters:**
- Arrows: ◄ ► (Unicode U+25C4, U+25BA)
- Box drawing: │ ─ ┌ ┐
- Blocks: █ ▓ ▒ ░ (for progress bars, patterns)

## NAMING & CODING SYSTEM

### Protocol Naming Convention
**Format:** `Protocol [Greek Letter]-[Odd Number]`

**Greek Letter = Theme Category:**
- **Theta (Θ)** - Control mechanisms, corporate training, mental hygiene
- **Delta (Δ)** - Reality construction, propaganda, media manipulation  
- **Sigma (Σ)** - Occult transmissions, esoteric content, conspiracy
- **Alpha (Α)** - Animated constructs, experimental animation
- **Omega (Ω)** - Unclassified signals, freeform, variable

**Number = Approximate Duration:**
- Rounds to nearest **odd number**
- Represents typical segment length in minutes
- Examples: Protocol Theta-7 (~7 min segments), Protocol Sigma-11 (~11 min segments)

**Additional Potential Greek Letters:**
- Gamma (Γ) - Radiation, transformation, mutation content
- Beta (Β) - Testing, experimentation, rough cuts
- Epsilon (Ε) - Error, deviation, glitch transmissions

### Content Cataloging Codes
**Individual Transmissions:** `TX-[Number]`
- Sequential archive ID
- Example: TX-001 (Duck and Cover), TX-047 (Swedish Rhapsody)

**Micro-Transmissions:** `MTX-[Letter][Number]`
- Letter = topic area (D=Dreams, B=Body, T=Thought, S=Subculture, H=History)
- Number = sequence
- Example: MTX-D01 (Dream Machine brief)

**Interstitials:** `INT-[Type][Number]`
- Type codes: A[decade]=Advertisement, S=Static, N=Numbers Station, C=Intermission
- Example: INT-A50-001 (1950s appliance ad), INT-S-003 (Static pattern)

**Frequency Notation (Optional):** `[Number].[Number] MHz`
- Mimics radio frequency
- Could map to time of day, thematic resonance, or remain mysterious
- Example: 540.7 MHz (Protocol Theta-7)

**User-Facing Display Format:**
```
◄ THETA-7 ► | 8M | 12/20
```
Meaning: Protocol Theta-7 active, 8 minutes remaining, 12 of 20 seats filled

For complete coding system documentation, see naming-conventions-working.ods

**Factory Records Influence:**
Similar to FAC numbering system - creates mystique through systematic but unexplained cataloging. Viewers may discover patterns but system is never officially explained.

## NUMBERS STATIONS AS INTERSTITIAL CONTENT

### What Are Numbers Stations?
Mysterious shortwave radio broadcasts (active since WWI, still broadcasting today):
- Anonymous voices reading numbers, letters, or phonetic alphabets
- Believed to be spy agencies sending encrypted messages to field operatives
- One-way communication, completely untraceable and deniable
- Never officially acknowledged by any government
- Perfect conceptual model for The Transmission Hypothesis

### Famous Examples in Our Library:
- **Swedish Rhapsody** - Child's voice with music box, deeply eerie
- **The Lincolnshire Poacher** - English folk song followed by numbers
- **Atención** - Cuban station, still active today
- **Warren Daly recordings** - Modern intercepts including North Korean stations
- Complete Conet Project collection available

### Implementation Strategy:
**Between Protocols:**
- Play numbers station recordings during off-hours
- 5-60 minute segments of pure transmission
- No explanation, no context
- Creates "you had to be there" mystery
- Viewers encounter static/numbers between scheduled content

**During Protocols:**
- Short numbers station clips as interstitials (30-90 seconds)
- Between archival films
- Creates disorientation and atmosphere
- Reinforces "intercepting transmissions" concept

**Effect:**
Reinforces that the theater is a listening post, not a streaming service. Between intelligible content, you hear the raw signal - mysterious, liminal, unsettling. An hour of Swedish Rhapsody between two shows without explanation = perfect.

See transmission-hypothesis-content.ods for cataloged numbers station sources.

## OSI 74 REFERENCE ANALYSIS

### What OSI 74 Does Well (Learn From):
- Commitment to VHS aesthetic (scan lines, tracking errors)
- Effective use of interstitials between segments
- Smart pacing (mixing content lengths)
- 24/7 continuous broadcast model
- SubGenius integration works through comedy framing
- Multiple platform delivery (web, Twitch, Roku)

### Key Differences (What NOT To Borrow):
- **OSI 74 = Overtly comedic, MST3K-style riffing, hosted segments**
- **TTH = Never breaks frame, no host, pure transmission**

OSI 74 tells you what you're watching. They explain. They make it ironic.
The Transmission Hypothesis broadcasts. You intercept. No explanation given.

### Structural Elements Worth Adapting:
- "Random Nonsense will run in breaks" → Our glitch/intrusion strategy
- Program guide concept → Our protocol schedule
- Multiple access points → Web + potential future platforms
- "Like your favorite TV channels of old" → Continuous broadcast feeling

### What to Avoid:
- Over-explaining content
- Comedy framing that makes it safe/ironic
- Host personality (breaks the transmission mystique)
- Platform name-dropping (Roku, Vimeo) in promotional materials
- "Hi-Tech shoes and kitchen faucets" humor - too winking

**Bottom Line:**
OSI 74 is Night Flight (entertainment, personality-driven).
The Transmission Hypothesis is a numbers station (pure signal, no DJ).

Both valid approaches to similar content, but very different editorial voices.

## UPDATED CRITICAL REMINDERS

### Never Break Frame
- Maintain "monitoring transmissions" voice at all times
- No fourth-wall breaks
- No explanations of the system
- Ambiguity is structural, not a bug

### Curation Is Ideology  
- What you juxtapose is what you're saying
- Sequence creates meaning without narration
- Pattern emerges differently for each receiver

### Scarcity As Feature
- 20 seats is permanent, not temporary
- Time scarcity (scheduled protocols) reinforces exclusivity
- Not trying to scale - small is the point

### The Transmission Exists Independent of Observation
- It's always been broadcasting
- Viewers don't "watch" - they intercept
- You are not discovering it, it is discovering you

### Typography & Interface
- CRT green on pure black
- Monospace only (IBM Plex Mono + VT323)
- Minimal UI - just status information
- Terminal aesthetic throughout
- No modern polish - equipment, not website

### Coding System
- Greek letters stay consistent to themes
- Odd numbers only for protocol durations
- Sequential numbering within categories
- Never explain the system to users
- Let viewers discover patterns organically

### Content Constraints
- Public domain only (Archive.org, Prelinger, NFB, British Pathé)
- Era-specific degradation (1950s=film grain, 1970s=VHS)
- No credits initially - everything feels intercepted
- Numbers stations between/during content
- Glitch/intrusion library for Phase C complexity
