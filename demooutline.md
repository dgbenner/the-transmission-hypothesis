# The Transmission Hypothesis - Demo Bullet Points

## What
- Experimental streaming theater sourcing films from Archive.org
- Synchronized broadcast playback with haunted transmission aesthetic
- Web-based with future RF broadcast capabilities

## Why
- Digital presence typically confined to internet infrastructure
- HAM radio offers alternate distribution beyond web-only
- Explores legal "pirate radio" concept for experimental media

## Demo Visuals
- Theater interface with seating visualization
- Film catalog/selection screen
- 2-3 films loading and playing smoothly
- Haunted transmission effects in action
- Cloudflare R2 video hosting integration
- Synchronized playback demonstration

## Next
- HAM radio broadcast implementation (with proper licensing)
- Expanding digital footprint into RF spectrum
- Building transmission capabilities beyond internet

# Sample Script with Visuals

**[THEATER INTERFACE loads, showing selection screen]**

"The Transmission Hypothesis is an experimental streaming theater that pulls films from Archive.org for synchronized broadcast playback."

**[Click first film, video loads and begins playing]**

"It's currently web-based, but the future vision is HAM radio broadcast capabilities—"

**[Show haunted transmission effects, switch to second film]**

"—expanding digital presence beyond internet infrastructure into the RF spectrum."

**[Demonstrate synchronized playback, maybe show catalog view]**

"Think legal pirate radio for experimental media distribution."

**[Show third film loading smoothly]**

"Next steps involve implementing actual radio transmission with proper HAM licensing, creating an alternate broadcast channel outside traditional web delivery."

**[Fade out or return to theater lobby]**

**Total runtime: ~60-75 seconds**

Focus on the concept and future direction rather than technical implementation details. The hook is "beyond the internet" not "Cloudflare R2 solved my CORS issues."
